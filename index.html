        <p> My favorite hobby is watching or reading anime. I like anime because it is inspirational and unique. Like the anime Naruto teaches you to never give up and chase your dreams. And there are some anime that make your smarter like Dr.Stone and Blood Cells At Work. The anime Dr.Stone teaches you how things work and how to make thing and Blood Cells at work teaches about the human body and all the cells and what they do for the human body, it also tells you about viruses in the human body. And there are some anime that are rather funny like Mob Psycho 100 And One Punch Man. These are comedy anime and they will make you laugh. And there are also some adventure anime like One Piece. One Piece is a good adeventure anime because it is almost 1000 episodes long and it will keep you busy; it also inspire you to make freinds and teaches you to value freindship. These are some of the reasons to like anime and why I like anime. </p>
